世界に気づかれぬように
真夜中を終わらせて
月が沈んでゆくように
The longest night will have an end.
"No No No! I'm sorry. I couldn't say goodbye to
you"
つまらない冗談はもう終わりにしようか
"I hate you" It's a joke. You meant to laugh.
"who are you" It's a joke. You meant to laugh.
"I hate you" It's a joke. You meant to laugh.
"who are you" It's a joke. You meant to laugh.
戻れない気がした あの羽 触れたら
泣くように笑う君が綺麗で
世界に気づかれぬように
真夜中を終わらせて
月が沈んでゆくように
The longest night will have an end.
you're dead to me.
気づけばYou got me. 探せば歪み
蝕んでいった 最後までFucked up
罪を隠したら 潰したならば
許されるのか i'm tired out. ayayayaya
"I hate you" It's a joke. You meant to laugh.
"who are you" It's a joke. You meant to laugh.
"I hate you" It's a joke. You meant to laugh.
"who are you" It's a joke. You meant to laugh.
戻れない気がした あの羽触れたら
泣くように笑ったのは私だ
世界に気づかれぬように
少年を終わらせて
私が僕に囁く
The longest night will have an end.
世界に気づかれぬように
真夜中を終わらせて
月が沈んでゆくように
The longest night will have an end.
